## New contributor guide

## Contributing

If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull
request.

If you plan to do something more involved, discuss your ideas on the
relevant GitHub issue.

If you noticed any problem or have an idea of new functionality, create
an issue about it.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem or had an ideia, [search if an issue already
exists](https://github.com/tmat-project/time-recorder-backend/issues).
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue following
the apropriate [issue template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE)

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing
issues](https://github.com/tmat-project/time-recorder-backend/issues)
to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using
`labels` as filters.

### Steps to contribute

To start your changes, first fork this repository and create a new

#### Dependency management

This project uses some external Python packages listed on the

We recommend to use a [virtual

dependency management.
